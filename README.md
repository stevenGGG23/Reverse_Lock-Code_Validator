This program processes a file containing lines of secret lock codes, where each line contains three integers. It checks if the integers in each line are unique and their sum is odd, defining valid lock codes. All valid codes are stored and then printed in reverse order from how they appeared in the file. The program uses functions to verify the uniqueness and odd-sum conditions. It reads the file once, processes the data, and then outputs the valid codes in reverse order to ensure only correctly validated codes are displayed.
